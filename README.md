# Merze E-commerce Application

A full-stack e-commerce web application that allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, and place orders through a smooth and intuitive interface.
Built to demonstrate real-world frontend–backend integration, reusable UI components, and RESTful API design.

Built with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and MongoDB database.

## Authentication

This project was built before I learned authentication with JWT, Clerk, or OAuth.

Users can register with an email address and log in using that same email. The application does not implement secure authentication or password hashing. The primary focus of this project was building a complete e-commerce workflow, including product browsing, shopping cart management, order placement, and RESTful API integration.

Secure authentication is listed as a future improvement.

## ⚡ Quick Start  

### 1. Clone and run the backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rakeshneopane/merze-ecommerce-backend.git
cd merze-ecommerce-backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Clone and run the frontend

Open a second terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rakeshneopane/merze-ecommerce-frontend.git
cd merze-ecommerce-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend communicates with the backend running on `http://localhost:4000`.

## 🔐 Environment Setup

### Frontend

Create a `.env` file inside the frontend project:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

For production:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://my-ecommerce-eta-ruby.vercel.app
```

### Backend

Create a `.env` file inside the backend project:

```env
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development

MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

For production, replace the localhost URLs with your deployed backend URL.

> **Note:**
>
> - Restart the development server after updating the `.env` file.
> - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive credentials.
